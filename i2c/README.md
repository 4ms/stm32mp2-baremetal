## HAL Audio example

This example demonstrates using the HAL SAI driver to send/receive audio from a codec via I2S.

To access the SAI peripheral, you must build OP-TEE with non-secure access granted to SAI2 and its clocks.

Our fork of OP-TEE (https://github.com/4ms/optee-stm32mp25) has this already done.

After building OP-TEE, update the FIP file with the new binaries and install the fip on the SD card.
